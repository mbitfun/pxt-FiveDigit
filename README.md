# pxt-fiveDigit
---
This library makes it possible to show 5 digit number on one screen.

## Example
---
You can show numbers like an abacus with this package as below.

![Numbers](https://github.com/mbitfun/pxt-fiveDigit/blob/readme/statics/numbers.png "numbers")

Up to 5 digits can be displayed. For example, 12345 is as shown below.

![five digit](https://github.com/mbitfun/pxt-fiveDigit/blob/readme/statics/fiveDigit.PNG "five digit")

<!-- 
Since the beta editor corresponds to the flow point, it can also be displayed at the decimal point.
Numbers below the decimal point blink.

![flow point](https://github.com/mbitfun/pxt-fiveDigit/blob/readme/statics/floatingPoint.gif "floating point")
 -->

## Basic Usage
---
```
fiveDigit.showNumber(number)
```

The argument 'number' can be an Integer only in the editor of the current version (https://makecode.microbit.org).
<!-- 
But it can be the Floating point in the editor in Beta (https://makecode.microbit.org/beta#editor).
