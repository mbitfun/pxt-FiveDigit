# pxt-fiveDigit
---
This library makes it possible to show 5 digit number on one screen.

## Example
---
You can show numbers like an abacus with this package as below.

![Numbers](https://github.com/mbitfun/pxt-fiveDigit/blob/readme/statics/numbers.png "numbers")

Up to 5 digits can be displayed. For example, 12345 is as shown below.

![five digit](https://github.com/mbitfun/pxt-fiveDigit/blob/readme/statics/fiveDigit.PNG "five digit")

Since the beta editor corresponds to the flow point, it can also be displayed at the decimal point.
Numbers below the decimal point blink.

![flow point](https://github.com/mbitfun/pxt-fiveDigit/blob/readme/statics/flowPoint.gif "flow point")

## Basic Usage

```
